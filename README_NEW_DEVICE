You need to set up a new .cc and .h file for the new type of device. Typically based
upon something already in place, these files define the methods associated with that
device, such as moving or querying.

Also, the new device type must be added to the stream.h file.

And finally, the new .h must be included in main.c, and the "network-client-*" keyword
added into the InitializePorts function.

Oh, and perhaps most importantly, entries for the new .cc and .o must be made in the Makefile!
